The Brazilian PHC system started in 1991 with the community health agents program and scaled up to the Family Health Program in 1994 when the initiative as a federal policy stablished a structure for PHC at the municipal level, providing financial resources for a Family Health Team (FHT) formed by one Physician, one Nurse and 4 to 6 Community Health Agents to take care of 4000 people living inside a catchment area. In Rio de Janeiro a PHC reform took place between 2009 and 2016115 when the Health Department created new community-based PC clinics and new FHT, increasing the coverage from 3.5% to almost 70% of the population of the city. Currently 1400 FHT are working in the city, providing care for more than 3.5 million people in a system that merges public funding with private non-for-profit organizations responsible for management and for structural and human resources.
