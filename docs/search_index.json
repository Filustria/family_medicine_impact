Has “evidence-based medicine” made primary care by generalist doctors an anachronism? General-practice research is too often about administration. A creeping managerialism is destroying one of primary care’s most important distinguishing traits—namely, the flexibility, informality, and pastoral strengths that come with a degree of laxity in its organisation. Evidence and primary care Nearly half of published studies in UK primary care journals were concerned with either organization and administration issues in primary care or social problems (509 studies, 48%). Just over half were either qualitative studies or surveys of opinion or attitudes (528 studies, 50%). The overall number of RCTs was low (67 studies, 6%), and the proportion published has not changed over time (chi 2 for trend = 3.79, df = 1, P = 0.051). In contrast to surgical journals, nearly one-fifth of studies in general practice followed a longitudinal design (186 studies, 18%). The content and methodology of research papers published in three United Kingdom primary care journals.

Monitoring and Evaluating Progress towards Universal Health Coverage in Brazil Capacity building of Human resources weak research policy, lack of research funding and infrastructure, complicated research bureaucracy and administrative process, as well as time constraints for conducting research relative to other duties. Participants expressed that personal motivation was a very important enabler/facilitator for increasing research activities. In order to improve research productivity, the majority of participants suggested that having local awards and formal recognition, having the opportunity to partner with local business and communities, provision of incentives, and having access to a research help-desk would be benefcial.

In municipalities with high Family Health Program enrollment, chronic disease hospitalization rates were 13 percent lower than in municipalities with low enrollment, when other factors were held constant. Major Expansion Of Primary Care In Brazil Linked To Decline In Unnecessary Hospitalization; James Macinko, Inês Dourado, Rosana Aquino, Palmira de Fátima Bonolo, Maria Fernanda Lima-Costa, Maria Guadalupe Medina, Eduardo Mota, Veneza Berenice de Oliveira, and Maria Aparecida Turci; HEALTH AFFAIRS VOL. 29, NO. 12 We observed a statistically significant negative association between FHP coverage and infant mortality rate. After we controlled for potential confounders, the reduction in the infant mortality rate was 13.0%, 16.0%, and 22.0%, respectively for the 3 levels of FHP coverage. The effect of the FHP was greater in municipalities with a higher infant mortality rate and lower human development index at the beginning of the study period.

(2017). doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0966 Statistically significant associations were found between indicators of ESF coverage and presence of SAMU with indicators of stroke and AMI mortality, for both sexes, except for male AMI. Analysis of prehospital care for stroke and acute myocardial infarction in the elderly population of Minas Gerais, Brazil A recomendação para outra pessoa dos serviços de saúde utilizados foi mais frequente entre usuários regulares da ESF (61,9%) e afiliados a plano privado (55,6%), em comparação à UBS (45,4%). Estratégia Saúde da Família em comparação a outras fontes de atenção: indicadores de uso e qualidade dos serviços de saúde em Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brasil FHP coverage was negatively associated with mortality rates from cerebrovascular and heart diseases (ambulatory care-sensitive conditions) in both unadjusted and adjusted models for demographic, social, and economic confounders. The FHP had no effect on the mortality rate for accidents, used as a control. The rate ratio for the effect of consolidated annual FHP coverage on cerebrovascular disease mortality and on heart disease mortality was 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.86) and 0.79 (0.75 to 0.80) respectively, reaching the value of 0.69 (0.66 to 0.73) and 0.64 (0.59 to 0.68) when the coverage was consolidated during all the previous eight years. Moreover, FHP coverage increased the number of health education activities, domiciliary visits, and medical consultations and reduced hospitalisation rates for cerebrovascular and heart disease. Several complementary analyses showed quantitatively similar results. Impact of primary health care on mortality from heart and cerebrovascular diseases in Brazil: a nationwide analysis of longitudinal data; Davide Rasella , Michael O Harhay, Marina L Pamponet, Rosana Aquino, Mauricio L Barreto; BMJ 2014;348:g4014 doi: 10.1136/bmj.g4014 A statistically significant negative association was observed between PSF coverage levels, classified in none (0%, the reference category), low (&lt;30.0%), intermediate (≥ 30.0% and &lt;70.0%) and high (≥ 70.0%), and all analysed mortalities rates, with a reduction of 17% (Rate Ratio [RR]: 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79 - 0.88), 35% (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.61-0.68) and 50% (RR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.47-0.53) on under-five mortality due to ill-defined causes, respectively. In the mortality rate for unattended death the reduction was even greater, reaching 60% (RR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.37-0.44) in the municipalities with the highest PSF coverage. The PSF effect on unattended deaths was slightly stronger in municipalities with a higher human development index. Research article Impact of the Family Health Program on the quality of vital information and reduction of child unattended deaths in Brazil: an ecological longitudinal study A statistically significant negative association was observed between FHP coverage levels, classified as none (the reference category), low (30%), intermediate (30% and 70%), or high (70%), and all analyzed mortality rates, with a reduction of 4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%– 6%), 9% (95% CI: 7%–12%), and 13% (95% CI: 10%–15%), respectively, on mortality rates or children younger than 5. The greatest effect was on postneonatal mortality. Reductions of 31% (95% CI: 20%– 40%) and 19% (95% CI: 8%–28%) in mortality rates from diarrheal diseases and lower respiratory infections, respectively, were found in the group of municipalities with the highest FHP coverage Reducing Childhood Mortality From Diarrhea and Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in Brazil The results indicate that children for whom the Family Health Program was available in their municipalities during the prenatal period are healthier than children for whom the program was not available during the same period of their lives. Public primary health care and children’s health in Brazil: evidence from siblings, Maurício Reis, J Popul Econ (2014) 27:421–445, DOI 10.1007/s00148-013-0482-8 We find consistent effects of the program on reductions in mortality throughout the age distribution, but mainly at earlier ages. Municipalities in the poorest regions of the country benefit particularly from the program. For these regions, implementation of the program is also robustly associated with increased labor supply of adults, reduced fertility, and increased school enrollment. Evidence suggests that the Family Health Program is a highly cost-effective tool for improving health in poor areas EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH INTERVENTIONS: EVIDENCE FROM BRAZIL’S FAMILY HEALTH PROGRAM, ROMERO ROCHA, RODRIGO R.

General practitioners (GPs) tend to focus most of their energies on providing primary healthcare to individuals, with less attention to the overall population health issues in their community. In contrast, public health practitioners tend to focus on the health needs of entire populations, by addressing the social determinants of health, with less attention to individual patient care.

Carey, Arthur E. Blank, and Laurie Newman Internações por condições sensíveis à atenção primária: a construção da lista brasileira como ferramenta para medir o desempenho do sistema de saúde (Projeto ICSAP – Brasil) Sensitive conditions accounted for 115,340 (26.4%) hospitalizations. Over the 4-year period, hospitalizations for sensitive conditions declined by 17.9%, vs only 8.3% for non-sensitive ones (P&lt;0.001). Hospitalization for sensitive conditions declined 22% for women in areas of high social vulnerability vs 9% for women in areas of low vulnerability (P&lt;0.001); for men, 17% vs 10% (P=0.11). Trends in hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions following the implementation of Family Health Teams in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, Claunara Schilling Mendonça, Erno Harzheim, Bruce B Duncan, Luciana Neves Nunes, Werner Leyh Internações por condições sensíveis à atenção primária à saúde, 2008-2015: uma análise do impacto da expansão da ESF na cidade do Rio de Janeiro Identificou-se tendência ao aumento da cobertura da ESF e à redução dos indicadores de ICSAP, bem como correlação inversa entre a cobertura pela ESF e a proporção de ICSAP (r = -0,888, p = 0,020), e entre a cobertura pela ESF e a taxa de ICSAP (r = -0,753, p = 0,031). Observou-se associação significativa para as razões de taxa dos indicadores de cobertura a partir de 2011 e de taxas de internação a partir de 2013.

Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions as an indicator of access to primary care and excess of bed supply Among these ecological studies with limited quality evidence, increasing coverage by the FHS was consistently associated with improvements in child mortality. Scarce evidence on other health outcomes, hospitalization and synergies with cash transfer was found.

Priority setting Stakeholder involvement in health research priority setting in low income countries: the case of Zambia; Lydia Kapiriri; Research Involvement and Engagement (2018) 4:41 Priority-setting for strategic funding programmes in public health research involves consultation mainly with researchers in the early phase of the process. There is an opportunity for greater breadth of participation and more transparency in priority-setting mechanisms for strategic funding programmes in population and public health research. Priority-setting in public health research funding organisations: an exploratory qualitative study among five high-profile funders. Past, present and future challenges in health care priority setting. Cash transfer programs Effect of a conditional cash transfer programme on childhood mortality: a nationwide analysis of Brazilian municipalities The association of higher FHP coverage with lower PNIM became stronger as BFP coverage increased. At the means of all other variables, when BFP coverage was 25%, predicted PNIM was 5.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.95, 5.53) for FHP coverage = 0% and 3.54 (95% CI = 2.77, 4.31) for FHP coverage = 100%. When BFP coverage was 60%, predicted PNIM was 4.65 (95% CI = 4.36, 4.94) when FHP coverage = 0% and 1.38 (95% CI = 0.88, 1.89) when FHP coverage = 100%.
